**Did you know that people with partial visual disabilities may struggle to read a text if its colors were chosen incorrectly?**
 
 This app idea was motivated by the desire to facilitate the creation of visually accessible interfaces!
 
 The idea consists of a **calculator that returns the contrast ratio between two colors**.
  
 Paying attention to the contrast ratio guidelines is essential because **the bigger the contrast ratio is, the more accessible your design can be.**

 
 Of course, the accessibility guidelines are way beyond only the colors contrast ratio, but that's a very important part of it and that's what we'll explore in this app.
